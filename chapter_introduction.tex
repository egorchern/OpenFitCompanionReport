\section{Motivation}
\par
In collaboration with NHS Manchester Royal Infirmary I have received a smart wearable device - Withings Watch,
and later Oura ring. It was during a time when I wanted to improve my fitness, and so I had an initial idea of an
application that would act as companion in my fitness journey. Such as reminding about activity, highlighting progress made and
possibly make suggestions in an autonomous way. Researching existing product offerings, none of them 
did everything I envisioned, or they had major drawbacks such as cost. I will elaborate in-depth on this further in \ref{section:similarSystems}

In the wider context, this topic is important because fitness is closely linked with a person's overall health, being a risk factor in developing depression, heart diseases and more \cite{nhsObesity}. and fitness levels have been on decline for both the UK and in the rest of the world.
For example, 63.5\% of adults in England are either obese or overweight \cite{ukObesity2023Survey}. It was estimated that obesity. As such, there is a lot of opportunities 
to use technology to help guide people towards healthier lives.
\par
On the personal note, what I found to be the hardest with fitness is staying consistent. It is especially tough because you don't 
see results immediately and it feels that you are not progressing. Also there may not be anybody who can hold you accountable, as your own motivation
is too easily influenced by your mood. This is something I wanted to provide with my application, hoping it would help somebody out there as it helped myself.
