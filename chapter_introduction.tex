\section{Motivation}
\par
In collaboration with NHS Manchester Royal Infirmary I have received smart wearable devices - Withings Watch,
and later Oura ring. It was during a time when I wanted to improve my fitness, and so I had an initial idea of an
application that would act as companion in a fitness journey. Such as reminding about activity, highlighting progress made and
possibly make suggestions in an autonomous way via wearable devices. Researching existing product offerings, none of them 
did everything I envisioned, or they had major drawbacks such as cost. I will elaborate in-depth on this further in \ref{section:similarSystems}
\par
In the wider context, this topic is important because fitness is closely linked with a person's overall health, being a risk factor in developing depression, heart diseases and more \cite{nhsObesity}. 
Fitness levels have been on decline for both the UK and in the rest of the world.
For example, as of Nov. 2021, 63.5\% of adults in England are either obese or overweight \cite{ukObesity2023Survey}. 
In Nov. 2022, It was estimated that obesity costs NHS Â£6 billion annually \cite{nhsObesityCost}.
Therefore, there is a large interest from institutions such as NHS to use technology to help combat this problem.

On a personal note, what I found to be the hardest with fitness is staying consistent. It is especially tough because you don't 
see results immediately and it feels that you are not progressing. It is also very tedious to manually track fitness related metrics.
Lastly, there might not be somebody that gives you encouragement or holding you accountable. I wanted to address all of those factors in my application, hoping it would help somebody out there as it helped myself.
\section{Aims}
On a high-level, those are the aims I wanted my application to fullfil.
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Data from any kind of wearable devices (provided they offer API) synced with the system in real-time. Stored in own database and presentable in a web dashboard}
\end{itemize}
