\section{Cloud Infrastructure}
Using cloud for the software service infrastructure has the benefit of off-loading complexity to cloud providers instead of handling it yourself. The services they provided are characterized as follows \cite{cloudServicesCategories}: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Serverless vs Server}
\subsection{Cloud Providers}
There are 3 major providers in this space: AWS, Azure and GCP. They fall into public cloud category, similar to utility services like Electricity, they are available for use to anyone, be it individual developer or a company. We are relying on third-parties to handle things such as legal compliance, disaster management etc. Providers outline their legal promises in the document called Service Level Agreement (SLA) \cite{cloudSLA}. Outlining major cloud provider's differences:

\end{itemize}

I chose AWS for this project for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{AWS has the best security system [cite], mainly due to IAM service, allowing for tight control of what a resource allowed to access in the infrastructure. }
    \item{if used under similar conditions, such as hosting the database in the same region in all comparisons, AWS has among the best quantative performance metrics, such as availability, latency etc \cite{CloudMetrics}  }
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Security}
Software Security is important, especially in the context of this project that deals with sensitive health data. Generic web-accessible recommendations should apply to this project, such as encryption, xss, etc. However, deploying the application on the cloud presents new security related challenges, which a lot of companies suffer from [cite].
