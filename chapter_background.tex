\section{Cloud Infrastructure}
Using cloud for the software service infrastructure has the benefit of off-loading complexity to cloud providers instead of handling it yourself. The services they provided are characterized as follows \cite{cloudServicesCategories}: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Serverless vs Server}
\subsection{Cloud Providers}
There are 3 major providers in this space: AWS, Azure and GCP.

Outlining major cloud provider's differences:

    \item{AWS has the best security system [cite], mainly due to IAM service, allowing for tight control of what a resource allowed to access in the infrastructure. }
\end{itemize}
