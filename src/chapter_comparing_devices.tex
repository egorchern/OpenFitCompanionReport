\chapter{Comparing Devices}
\section{Research Task}
The core application allows easy access to meassurements from multiple devices in a csv format. This enables researchers to analyse the data to answer research questions. As a supplementary project task, a data analysis was performed to answer the following research question: "Do devices used (Withing scanwatch and Oura gen 2 ring) produce significantly different measurements for common fields?" Importantly, this is not the same as answering: "Are devices used accurate?", as that would require much more rigorous study; that would require ground-truth measurements for every day, which are hard to acquire in practice, as those machines are expensive, non-mobile, require technician, etc. So it would be a very expensive, industry-level study, which is out of scope for this project. Instead, the precision of the differences is examined rather than accuracy. 
\section{Data}
There are 60 days of my own personal data from both devices for every day. I always wore both devices at the same time, never one device but not the other; Both devices were configured properly - such as indicating correct weight in both apps every week and setting reference values for heart-rates to automatic. That means that data from devices is directly comparable. It is only 60 days because I acquired the ring later in the year than the watch, around the end of December, so earlier data could not be used as there is no corresponding ring data.
