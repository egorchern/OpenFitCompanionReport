Smart health-tracking devices and apps that leverage them have gained popularity as people become more health-conscious. However, due to the restrictiveness of many companies, the data is dispersed and not utilised effectively for guidance towards a healthier lifestyle. Many commercial apps try to tackle this problem, but most are inadequate in some criteria, such as transparency or cost. Profit incentives prevent users from receiving the best experience. The report presents OpenFitCompanion, an open-source, self-deployable, cross-platform application, designed as an event-driven composition of serverless microservices, that integrates data from fitness trackers to create helpful and highly personalised insights using a mixture of algorithms and Large Language Models (LLM).  Evaluating the final artefact for various criteria: cost, security and more, has shown that the application is a strong competitor to free apps on the market, but failing to present a better utility to cost ratio against paid apps. Nevertheless, it provides a strong foundation on which further improvements and optimisations can be applied.

Enabled by the core application, a research question: "Are examined devices different?" was investigated using two months of personal fitness data. Framing  the problem as an equivalence test and performing t-tests displayed evidence for significant difference in measurement of activity seconds at different intensities. However, a more rigorous study would be required to draw any conclussions, as user errors and low sample size could have had an impact on the results. 

We hope that OpenFitCompanion advances the domain of fitness tracking apps towards more open and decentralised architectures and facilitates further studies into health-tracking devices.
