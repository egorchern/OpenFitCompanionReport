  abstract = {Physical inactivity is one of the most important risk factors for non-communicable diseases. Workplace health promotion is therefore of growing interest to support an active day using nudges. The scoping review aims to (a) analyse how frequently nudges are applied in workplace health promotion to increase physical activity and/or reduce sedentary behaviour, and (b) characterise the nudges used. A systematic database search was conducted for the period 2009 to June 2020. According to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, studies promoting physical activity and/or reducing sedentary behaviour using nudges were included. Nudges were classified according to MINDSPACE and TIPPME. A study protocol was previously published. Of the 256 studies identified, 26 used nudges. Most studies were conducted in Europe (n = 12) and the USA (n = 8). N = 18 studies targeted physical activity and n = 8 studies targeted sedentary behaviour. In most studies promoting physical activity, prompts were given to climb stairs (n = 11). Interventions targeting sedentary behaviour were more diverse, using digital interventions or mixed approaches (n = 8). Although nudges can help increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour, there are still gaps in terms of their effective and efficient use. There is a lack of long-term studies that analyse habituation and behavioural changes beyond the intervention period. In addition, the potential of digital and mixed approaches is not yet fully exploited. Further studies from low- and middle-income countries with different climates and working conditions are needed to investigate the feasibility of approaches and advance the fight against physical inactivity.}

  abstract = { Mobile health tools that enable clinicians and researchers to monitor the type, quantity, and quality of everyday activities of patients and trial participants have long been needed to improve daily care, design more clinically meaningful randomized trials of interventions, and establish cost-effective, evidence-based practices. Inexpensive, unobtrusive wireless sensors, including accelerometers, gyroscopes, and pressure-sensitive textiles, combined with Internet-based communications and machine-learning algorithms trained to recognize upper- and lower-extremity movements, have begun to fulfill this need. Continuous data from ankle triaxial accelerometers, for example, can be transmitted from the home and community via WiFi or a smartphone to a remote data analysis server. Reports can include the walking speed and duration of every bout of ambulation, spatiotemporal symmetries between the legs, and the type, duration, and energy used during exercise. For daily care, this readily accessible flow of real-world information allows clinicians to monitor the amount and quality of exercise for risk factor management and compliance in the practice of skills. Feedback may motivate better self-management as well as serve home-based rehabilitation efforts. Monitoring patients with chronic diseases and after hospitalization or the start of new medications for a decline in daily activity may help detect medical complications before rehospitalization becomes necessary. For clinical trials, repeated laboratory-quality assessments of key activities in the community, rather than by clinic testing, self-report, and ordinal scales, may reduce the cost and burden of travel, improve recruitment and retention, and capture more reliable, valid, and responsive ratio-scaled outcome measures that are not mere surrogates for changes in daily impairment, disability, and functioning. }

  abstract = {Purpose
              Although wearable activity trackers hold a promise of nudging people toward a more active lifestyle, current research reveals inconsistent findings regarding the effectiveness of them. The objectives of this paper are two-fold: (1) to synthesize evidence on the effects of wearable activity trackers for improving physical activities, and (2) to identify potential moderators of effect size.
              Methods
              A systematic meta-analytic review was conducted. Forty-eight eligible papers based on forty-four distinct trials were identified through a systematic literature search process. Two authors independently extracted information from each study based on predefined data fields. Random-effects meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression analysis were employed.
              Results
              First, interventions with wearable activity trackers significantly increased daily steps and weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity but had no impact on light physical activity or sedentary behavior. Second, daily steps and weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were associated with participants’ characteristics (i.e., gender, age, medical condition, and baseline physical activity level) and intervention features (i.e., sensors, modes of expert support, and intervention duration). The identified factors explained 53 % of the total variance for weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.
              Conclusions
              The use of wearable activity trackers effectively improves conscious exercise behavior, including daily steps and weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, but not effective for modifying habitual behavior, such as light physical activity and sedentary behavior. We also explicitly show that the extent to which the interventions with wearable activity trackers help users is contingent on the type of users and the design and delivery of interventions. Future studies are called to validate the findings and to offer theoretical explanations.}

  abstract = {The increasing popularity of activity trackers has shown a remarkable shift in human computer interaction; individuals seem willing to wear a device that constantly tracks health related metrics such as movement, exercise, sleep, and calorie burn. Using the insights derived from their activity trackers, individuals are expected to be more empowered to set and stick to personal health goals. Whereas the outcome of using activity trackers is of great importance to both individuals and society at large, there are no empirical studies substantiating this presumption. This study aims to contribute to filling this research gap. Making use of self-regulation theory as theoretical framework, we developed a model that proposes six system specific elements (attractiveness, monitoring, feedback, privacy protection, readability, and gamification) as determinants of health empowerment, and thereof health commitment. Using survey data collected from individuals wearing smart wristbands (N = 210), the model was validated. Overall, the results provide strong support for the health empowering capabilities of smart wristbands. The paper concludes with implications for theory and practice, and some suggestions for future research.}

abstract = {Statistics is the study of populations, how they relate to one another and what effect sampling has in terms of representing the original population. Use of statistical tools has been facilitated by modern computer technology; however, given the ease in which results are obtained, it is easy to overlook potentially incorrect use of the various statistical tests. Statistical tools are invaluable for investigators because they make it possible to determine if scientific results are important. When a test is used, it is important to know that the result of any statistical test is valid to avoid erroneous conclusions. To do so, the investigator must have a basic understanding of the test’s assumptions and limitations. Modern statistical packages often include a variety of results relating to the test’s applicability to the data analyzed. Not uncommonly, biologists are unfamiliar with these analyses. This review intends to improve the reader’s understanding of t-tests by providing a history of Student’s t-test, and its assumptions, applications, and limitations. Part 1 of the series (“The Mean and Standard Deviation: What Does It All Mean?”) reviewed basic aspects of distributions, measures of central tendency, and dispersion assessment. Small sample size effects on accurate estimation of a population mean and group comparisons for continuous data are presented in this review.}

abstract = {A hypothesis has been advanced that the primary function of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is to provide periodic endogenous stimulation to the brain which serves to maintain minimum requisite levels of CNS activity throughout sleep. REM, in effect, is the mechanism used by the brain to promote and ensure recovery from sleep. Failures of REM may hinder, or in extreme cases, prevent arousal from sleep. The possibility that two fatal sleep-associated syndromes (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and the Oriental Nocturnal Death Syndrome) may involve deficits of REM was discussed.}

  abstract  = {Background Older people are at high risk of physical inactivity. Activity trackers can facilitate physical activity. We aimed to investigate the effect of interventions using activity trackers on physical activity, mobility, quality of life and mental health among people aged 60+ years.Methods For this systematic review, we searched eight databases, including MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL from inception to April 2018. Randomised controlled trials of interventions that used activity trackers to promote physical activity among people aged 60+ years were included in the analyses. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017065250.Results We identified 23 eligible trials. Interventions using activity trackers had a moderate effect on physical activity (23 studies; standardised mean difference (SMD)=0.55; 95\% CI 0.40 to 0.70; I2=86\%) and increased steps/day by 1558 (95\% CI 1099 to 2018 steps/day; I2=92\%) compared with usual care, no intervention and wait-list control. Longer duration activity tracker-based interventions were more effective than short duration interventions (18 studies, SMD=0.70; 95\% CI 0.47 to 0.93 vs 5 studies, SMD=0.14; 95\% CI -0.26 to 0.54, p for comparison=0.02). Interventions that used activity trackers improved mobility (three studies; SMD=0.61; 95\% CI 0.31 to 0.90; I2=10\%), but not quality of life (nine studies; SMD=0.09; 95\% CI -0.07 to 0.25; I2=45\%). Only one trial included mental health outcomes and it reported similar effects of the activity tracker intervention compared with control.Conclusions Interventions using activity trackers improve physical activity levels and mobility among older people compared with control. However, the impact of activity tracker interventions on quality of life, and mental health is unknown.},

  abstract = {Background: Wearable activity trackers (trackers) are increasingly popular devices used to track step count and other health indicators. Trackers have the potential to benefit those in need of increased physical activity, such as adults who are older and face significant health challenges. These populations are least likely to purchase trackers and most likely to face challenges in using them, yet may derive educational, motivational, and health benefits from their use once these barriers are removed. Objective: The aim of this pilot research is to investigate the use of trackers by adults with chronic medical conditions who have never used trackers previously. Specifically, we aim to determine (1) if participants would accept and use trackers to increase their physical activity; (2) if there were barriers to use besides cost and training; (3) if trackers would educate participants on their baseline and ongoing activity levels and support behavior change; and (4) if clinical outcomes would show improvements in participants' health. Methods: This study was conducted with patients (N=10) in a 12-week physician-led wellness group offered by Family Doctors, LLC. Patients were given trackers in the second week of The Wellness Group and were interviewed 2 to 4 weeks after it ended. The study investigators analyzed the interview notes to extract themes about the participants' attitudes and behavior changes and collected and analyzed participants' clinical data, including weight and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol over the course of the study. Results: Over the 12 to 14 weeks of tracker use, improvements were seen in clinical outcomes, attitudes towards the trackers, and physical activity behaviors. Participants lost an average of 0.5 lbs per week (SD 0.4), with a mean total weight loss of 5.97 lbs (P=.004). Other short-term clinical outcomes included a 9.2{\%} decrease in LDL levels (P=.038). All participants reported an increase in well-being and confidence in their ability to lead more active lives. We identified the following 6 major attitudinal themes from our qualitative analysis of the interview notes: (1) barriers to tracker purchase included cost, perceived value, and choice confusion; (2) attitudes towards the trackers shifted for many, from half of the participants expressing excitement and hope and half expressing hesitation or trepidation, to all participants feeling positive towards their tracker at the time of the interviews; (3) trackers served as educational tools for baseline activity levels; (4) trackers provided concrete feedback on physical activity, which motivated behavior change; (5) tracker use reinforced wellness group activities and goals; and (6) although commitment to tracker use did not waver, external circumstances influenced some participants' ongoing use. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that adding trackers to wellness groups comprising primarily older adults with chronic medical conditions can support education and behavior change to be more physically active. The trackers increased participant self-efficacy by providing a tangible, visible reminder of a commitment to increasing activity and immediate feedback on step count and progress towards a daily step goal. While acceptance was high and attitudes ultimately positive, training and support are needed and short-term drop-off in participant use is to be expected. Future research will further consider the potential of trackers in older adults with chronic medical conditions who are unlikely to purchase them, and studies will use larger samples, continue over a longer period of time, and evaluate outcomes independent of a wellness group. },

  abstract = {Background: The range of benefits associated with regular physical activity participation is irrefutable. Despite the well-known benefits, physical inactivity remains one of the major contributing factors to ill-health throughout industrialized countries. Traditional lifestyle interventions such as group education or telephone counseling are effective at increasing physical activity participation; however, physical activity levels tend to decline over time. Consumer-based wearable activity trackers that allow users to objectively monitor activity levels are now widely available and may offer an alternative method for assisting individuals to remain physically active. Objective: This review aimed to determine the effects of interventions utilizing consumer-based wearable activity trackers on physical activity participation and sedentary behavior when compared with interventions that do not utilize activity tracker feedback. Methods: A systematic review was performed searching the following databases for studies that included the use of a consumer-based wearable activity tracker to improve physical activity participation: Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, SPORTDiscus, and Health Technology Assessments. Controlled trials of adults comparing the use of a consumer-based wearable activity tracker with other nonactivity tracker--based interventions were included. The main outcome measures were physical activity participation and sedentary behavior. All studies were assessed for risk of bias, and the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system was used to rank the quality of evidence. The guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement were followed. A random-effects meta-analysis was completed on the included outcome measures to estimate the treatment effect of interventions that included an activity tracker compared with a control group. Results: There was a significant increase in daily step count (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.24; 95{\%} CI 0.16 to 0.33; P<.001), moderate and vigorous physical activity (SMD 0.27; 95{\%} CI 0.15 to 0.39; P<.001), and energy expenditure (SMD 0.28; 95{\%} CI 0.03 to 0.54; P=.03) and a nonsignificant decrease in sedentary behavior (SMD −0.20; 95{\%} CI −0.43 to 0.03; P=.08) following the intervention versus control comparator across all studies in the meta-analyses. In general, included studies were at low risk of bias, except for performance bias. Heterogeneity varied across the included meta-analyses ranging from low (I2=3{\%}) for daily step count through to high (I2=67{\%}) for sedentary behavior. Conclusions: Utilizing a consumer-based wearable activity tracker as either the primary component of an intervention or as part of a broader physical activity intervention has the potential to increase physical activity participation. As the effects of physical activity interventions are often short term, the inclusion of a consumer-based wearable activity tracker may provide an effective tool to assist health professionals to provide ongoing monitoring and support. },

The goal of this paper is to explore how practicioners perceive this artifact in the context of requirements engineering. [Principal ideas/results] We explore perceived effectiveness of user stories by reporting on a survey with 182 responses from practitioners and 21 follow-up semi-structured interviews. The data shows that practitioners agree that using user stories, a user story template and quality guidelines such as the INVEST mnemonic improve their productivity and the quality of their work deliverables. [Contribution] By combining the survey data with 21 semi-structured follow-up interviews, we present 12 findings on the usage and perception of user stories by practitioners that employ user stories in their everyday work environment.},

This paradigm brings benefits such as less operational complexity, a pay-as-you-go pricing model, and an auto-scaling feature. The paradigm opens up new opportunities and challenges for cloud application developers. In this article, we present a comprehensive overview of the past development as well as the recent advances in research areas related to serverless computing. First, we survey serverless applications introduced in the literature. We categorize applications in eight domains and separately discuss the objectives and the viability of the serverless paradigm along with challenges in each of those domains. We then classify those challenges into nine topics and survey the proposed solutions. Finally, we present the areas that need further attention from the research community and identify open problems.},

abstract = {Scientific workflows consisting of a high number of interdependent tasks represent an important class of complex scientific applications. Recently, a new type of serverless infrastructures has emerged, represented by such services as Google Cloud Functions and AWS Lambda, also referred to as the Function-as-a-Service model. In this paper we take a look at such serverless infrastructures, which are designed mainly for processing background tasks of Web and Internet of Things applications, or event-driven stream processing. We evaluate their applicability to more compute- and data-intensive scientific workflows and discuss possible ways to repurpose serverless architectures for execution of scientific workflows. We have developed prototype workflow executor functions using AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions, coupled with the HyperFlow workflow engine. These functions can run workflow tasks in AWS and Google infrastructures, and feature such capabilities as data staging to/from S3 or Google Cloud Storage and execution of custom application binaries. We have successfully deployed and executed the Montage astronomy workflow, often used as a benchmark, and we report on initial results of its performance evaluation. Our findings indicate that the simple mode of operation makes this approach easy to use, although there are costs involved in preparing portable application binaries for execution in a remote environment. While our solution is an early prototype, we find the presented approach highly promising. We also discuss possible future steps related to execution of scientific workflows in serverless infrastructures. Finally, we perform a cost analysis and discuss implications with regard to resource management for scientific applications in general.}

    abstract =  {An application server can use the Voluntary Application Server Identification (VAPID) method described in this document to voluntarily identify itself to a push service. The "vapid" authentication scheme allows a client to include its identity in a signed token with requests that it makes. The signature can be used by the push service to attribute requests that are made by the same application server to a single entity. The identification information can allow the operator of a push service to contact the operator of the application server. The signature can be used to restrict the use of a push message subscription to a single application server.},
